HTML:
there's too much repeated code (like w the google fonts api links). Create a 'shared html' for that

<!-- SIGN UPS
Write Js or Python code to check that password and confirm password fields match -->

<!-- LOGIN
Use email and password to login. Not username and password. Since we might have diff users with same usernames -->

BOOKMARKS
Add column(DateAdded)

LOGIN/SIGNUP
<!-- 1. Could we grab the signed in user's username. Which we can then show them in the templates -->
<!-- eg check the /saved_places route -->
2. Maybe put checks for the length of the password

<!-- PLACE DETAILS HTML
The /place route will show all the places to the user. The user
can then click a place for more details. I had tried implementing that but it still has issues/errors. 
We should check that -->

CODE CHECKING
We might consider adding checks both in the server and client (with both Python and JS)

URL
I feel like we'll have too many urls(pages), like /saved_places, /register, /login, /home etc. We'll see if we can maybe do sth like in typeracer, where we change a page but maybe the url will still be showing the homepage. eg when a user wants to login or sign up.

NOSCRIPT
Add a <noscript> to all our html. Users must have Js enabled in their browsers if they want to use our site

404
Create our 404 page

LOCATION
I feel like we should just get the user's location automatically. we shouldn't give the user the option of "setting the location manually"

PLACES (ALREADY IMPLEMENTED, TO BE COUNTER CHECKED BY RAYMOND)
In the /places api route, add a field (bookmarks) for the returned results, this field will only be available if the user is signed in, this will allow the user to bookmark places for easy future reference

USERNAME (/register)
During registration check if username already exists to avoid duplicates

<!-- URL FOR CLICKED PLACE
it's currently set to /place/place_name
set it to /place/place_id -->

<!-- ADD IMAGE SLIDER FOR SPECIFIC PLACE
Will depend on the number of pics that place has
Loop and for each create a new image -->

<!-- FORMS
clicking enter key should do the same thing as when user clicks the submit  button -->



ADD COMMENTS TO THE CODE
<!-- 
@LOGIN_REQUIRED
The route /saved_places should only be accessible to logged in users.
If a user enters it manually on the page and they are not logged in, they should be redirected to the login page -->

LOGGING OUT

HTML ESCAPING


Sometimes the results shown in the /place route are diff from what the user entered

The 'save place' doesn't work well

/LOGIN
handle the error well when trying to log in with a username that don't exist

LOCATION
How do we continuously ask the user to grant us location permission, i.e., when they first don't allow the app to access it [we could also allow the user to use a default location (which we willl set), ie if they only want to see the app's functionality, we could use an already defined location to make that happen]

why do we not have all the reviews

check how we handle the try/except blocks. instead of printing the error we should know what to show the user

in the future: integrate google's authentication during sign up to make the process seamless for our users

FOR SIGNED IN USERS
if a user goes to the specific place route, maybe add that place to their "recently viewed places"
