HTML:
there's too much repeated code (like w the google fonts api links). Create a 'shared html' for that

SIGN UPS
Write Js or Python code to check that password and confirm password fields match

BOOKMARKS
Add column(DateAdded)

LOGIN/SIGNUP
1. Could we grab the signed in user's username. Which we can then show them in the templates
eg check the /saved_places route
2. Maybe put checks for the length of the password

PLACE DETAILS HTML
The /place route will show all the places to the user. The user
can then click a place for more details. I had tried implementing that but it still has issues/errors. 
We should check that

CODE CHECKING
We might consider adding checks both in the server and client (with both Python and JS)

URL
I feel like we'll have too many urls(pages), like /saved_places, /register, /login, /home etc. We'll see if we can maybe do sth like in typeracer, where we change a page but maybe the url will still be showing the homepage. eg when a user wants to login or sign up.

NOSCRIPT
Add a <noscript> to all our html. Users must have Js enabled in their browsers if they want to use our site

404
Create our 404 page

LOCATION
I feel like we should just get the user's location automatically, like we shouldn't give the user the option of "setting the location manually"

PLACES (ALREADY IMPLEMENTED, TO BE COUNTER CHECKED BY RAYMOND)
In the /places api route, add a field (bookmarks) for the returned results, this field will only be available if the user is signed in, this will allow the user to bookmark places for easy future reference
