# INTRODUCTION
Karibu Nami aims to address the challenge of efficiently accessing and understanding information about local businesses and services when one visits an unfamiliar place. Current search methods, like using search engines such as Google, provide fragmented data on places like hotels, barbershops, supermarkets, and schools near the user's location. The problem is that this information is often not well visualized and challenging for users to digest and utilize effectively.

Our app is designed to assist travelers, tourists, and anyone exploring new areas who seek quick and user-friendly access to information about local establishments. It is adaptable to various locales and regions
